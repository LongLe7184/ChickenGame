**Version 1.0**
_The game is still in progess_
- Chickens is now spawn slowly, sequentially. It can dynamically changes based on the difficulty level system.
- "Game Over " notification message box will pop up whenever chickens collide with player. "Try Again" button will also appears to let the player restart from the beginning.
- Scoreboard was added to record player's achivement.

NOTE: Currently, the player is not controllable yet. This feature will be added when there is a peripheral device send signal to the app.
(I will try to use an Arduino adapt with a joy stick to test this future)
